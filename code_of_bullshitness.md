# Code of Bullshitness

This code is an example of bullshitness at its summit, add your piece of bullshit with your pull request.

The *bsd-true* module is a copylefted package with a GNU Licence but it's ported from a BSD public domain program. That's just the beginnig, you can download this package from NPM and contribute to the whole messy and unnecesary Node.js package dependency shit!

But wait, if you call now we'll send you an obfuscated Javascript code for free, call now and get *bsd-true* plus the obfuscated code.

Send us some feedback or we'll go and add some unfinished ECMAScript to your code.
